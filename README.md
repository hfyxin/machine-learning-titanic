# machine-learning-titanic
Python solution to the Titanic dataset on Kaggle, with sklearn library.

This exercise demonstrates many useful machine learning techniques: data inspection, preprocess pipeline, cross-validation, grid search and evaluation metrics.

So far only Logistic Regression is applied. No plan to extend this work.
